# GA WDI Project 4:  CARbon Footprints

This web app is intended to help users examine the impact of everyday decisions on the environment.  As a first step, the app will (I hope!!!) allow users to input start and end locations, and get a comparison of greenhouse gas emissions for driving vs taking public transportation.

**_About the Building of this App_**

I expect this app will use MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node, Google Maps Directions API, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS.  User authentication (if possible) would be via Passport.

Currently, the app is envisioned with 3 models - User, Address, and Trip.
